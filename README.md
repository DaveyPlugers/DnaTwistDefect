# DnaTwistDefect

This is the code used during my master thesis with regards to simulationd twist defects on DNA

The current repository needs to be cleaned and sorted, as well as some removal of unneeded comments.
If you are interested in the project feel free to contact me at: daveyplugers@gmail.com

Main functions and code:

Simulation_Nucleosome (This models the movement of the nucleosome on a large string of DNA)

Nucleosome_Transition_Function (This simulates the remodeler and the movement of the defects on the nucleosome)

Full_DNA_Energy_Landscape (This function uses the geometry functions to calculate the energy costs of the defects on all positions)
